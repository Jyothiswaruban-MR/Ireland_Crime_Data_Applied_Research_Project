Ireland Crime Data – Applied Research Project

This project is an interactive crime analytics dashboard for Ireland, built using Python and Streamlit.
It was developed as part of an Applied Research Project to explore long-term crime trends using publicly available data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ireland.

The main goal of the project is to make Irish crime data easy to explore, understand, and interpret through interactive visualisations, filters, and simple narrative insights.

Rather than presenting static charts, this dashboard allows users to ask questions of the data — such as how crime has changed over time, how it varies by region or Garda division, and which offence types are most common.
